# nfl_veripy: Formal Verification of Neural Feedback Loops (NFLs)

## Updates

- **2023-07-20:** Added typing hints and re-factored visualization code as separate from other components.
- **2023-04-21:** Major cleanup and re-branding of repo, released PyPi package for easier usability!
- **2023-04-13:** Add new jax-based propagators, including some from [`DRIP` paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04646). Cleaned up implementation of BReach-LP and HyBReach-LP from OJCSYS paper.
- **2022-06-20:** Add new backprojection code from [`BReach-LP` paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08319). More info [here](/docs/_static/cdc22/cdc22.md)
- **2022-05-09:** Add new N-Step `ClosedLoopPropagator`. Rather than recursively computing reachable sets (suffers from the wrapping effect), we see improved performance by solving an LP directly for the reachable set N steps in the future. You can experiment with this using the `CROWNNStep` flag in `nfl_veripy/example.py`.
- **2022-05-09:** Add new MILP-based `ClosedLoopPropagator`, using [`OVERT`](https://github.com/sisl/OVERTVerify.jl). Note that this component requires a Julia installation, and we pass data between Python and Julia using a lightweight local HTTP server. More info [here](/docs/_static/other.md).

## About

`nfl_veripy` is a Python codebase for formal safety verification of neural feedback loops (NFLs).
An example of an NFL is a dynamical system controlled by a neural network policy.

Currently, **`nfl_veripy` handles problems such as:**
- Given a set of possible initial states, a trained NN controller, and a known dynamics model, compute outer bounds on the set of possible future states (**forward reachable sets**).
- Given a set of terminal states, a trained NN controller, and a known dynamics model, compute inner/outer bounds on the set of possible initial states that will/won't lead to the terminal state set (**backprojection sets**).

For more info, please see [this README](/docs/_static/access21/access21.md) and [this README](/docs/_static/cdc22/cdc22.md).

## Setup

If you just want to run the code, you can simply install our package via pip:
```bash
pip install \
    "jax_verify @ git+https://gitlab.com/neu-autonomy/certifiable-learning/jax_verify.git" \
    "crown_ibp @ git+https://gitlab.com/neu-autonomy/certifiable-learning/crown_ibp.git" \
    nfl_veripy
```

### Simple Examples

Compute forward reachable sets for a closed-loop system with a pre-trained NN control policy:
```bash
python -m nfl_veripy.example --config example_configs/icra21/fig3_reach_lp.yaml
```

Compute backward reachable sets for a closed-loop system with a pre-trained NN control policy:
```bash
python -m nfl_veripy.example --config example_configs/ojcsys23/di_breach.yaml
```

## Developer Setup

If you want to work directly with the source code, here is how we set up our development environments.

### Get the code

```bash
git clone --recursive <this_repo>
```

### Install

You *might* need to install these dependencies on Linux (for `cvxpy`'s SCS solver and to generate reasonably sized animation files) (did not need to on OSX):
```bash
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gifsicle libgmp3-dev
```

Create a `virtualenv` for this repo:
```bash
python -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the various python packages in this repo in editable mode (`-e`):
```bash
python -m pip install -e third_party/crown_ibp
python -m pip install -e third_party/jax_verify
python -m pip install -e third_party/auto_LiRPA
python -m pip install -e .
```

You're good to go!
